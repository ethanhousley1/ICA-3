I have learned quite a bit about html. I had no idea you could wrap elements around other elements. In css, I learned that you can do something like span>h2 and I had no idea that was even a thing before this class. As for github, I used it a lot in IS 303 but I had no idea how to use git or any command line arguments to do anything, I just used VSCode, and I'm glad I know how to do it manually.
